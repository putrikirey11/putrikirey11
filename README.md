Hello! âœ¨

I'm an Aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for data analysis and visualization. Armed with the belief that small, consistent steps can yield extraordinary results.
I have a keen interest in data collection, digital advancements, and art/design. My life mission is to continue learning, evolving, and working towards becoming a professional in areas that truly captivate my curiosity.

Currently, I am studying Data Science and pursuing Data Scientist courses at Rakamin Academy. I'm honing my programming skills using PGAdmin (SQL), Jupyter Notebook, and mastering data visualization with Google Looker Studio.
